<html><body><p>PyDev is a popular plugin for Eclipse that allows for Python development. One common issue that users encounter is the 'Undefined variable from import' error. Here's how you can resolve this problem:

### 1. Ensure Proper Installation
First, make sure that PyDev and your Python interpreter are properly installed in Eclipse.

- **PyDev Installation**: Go to `Help -> Eclipse Marketplace`, search for PyDev, and install it.
- **Python Interpreter Configuration**: Go to `Window -> Preferences -> PyDev -> Interpreters -> Python Interpreter` and configure your Python interpreter.

### 2. Configure the PYTHONPATH
Sometimes the issue arises because PyDev cannot find the modules. You need to ensure that the required directories are included in the PYTHONPATH.

- **Adding Source Folders**: Go to `Project -> Properties -> PyDev - PYTHONPATH` and add the necessary source folders.
- **Adding External Libraries**: In the same window, you can also add external libraries if your project depends on them.

### 3. Check Syntax and Imports
Ensure that the modules and variables are correctly imported in your scripts.

- **Explicit Imports**: Instead of using wildcard imports like `from module import *`, use explicit imports like `from module import specific_variable_or_function`.
- **Namespace Issues**: Check for naming conflicts and ensure that variable names do not conflict with module names.

### 4. Refresh and Rebuild
Sometimes simply refreshing the project and rebuilding it can clear the errors.

- **Refresh**: Right-click on the project and select Refresh, or use `F5`.
- **Rebuild**: Go to `Project -> Clean` and clean the project.

### 5. Code Analysis and Overrides
Ensure that PyDevâ€™s code analysis is correctly recognizing your imports.

- **@UndefinedVariable Override**: You can suppress false positives by adding comments to your code. For example,
  ```python
  import some_module  # @UnusedImport
  some_variable = some_module.some_function()  # @UndefinedVariable
  ```

### 6. Interpreter and Environment Settings
Make sure that the interpreter settings in Eclipse match the environment where your Python scripts are actually running.

- **Virtual Environments**: If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is selected in PyDev.
- **Interpreter Configuration**: Ensure the configured interpreter in PyDev matches the one where your dependencies are installed.

### 7. Update and Restart
- **Update PyDev**: Sometimes, simply updating PyDev to the latest version can solve the problem.
- **Restart Eclipse**: Restarting Eclipse can sometimes resolve configuration issues.

### 8. Advanced Configuration
- **Preferences Settings**: Go to `Window -> Preferences -> PyDev -> Code Analysis` and adjust the settings there as needed.
- **IDE Logs**: Check the Eclipse logs (`Window -> Show View -> Error Log`) for any additional clues.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve most 'Undefined variable from import' errors in PyDev. If the issue persists, consider checking online forums, the official PyDev documentation, or reporting the issue with specific details to get more targeted help.</p></body></html>
